# Suffix Tree

This is an implementation of a suffix tree. It takes a string and stores it in a tree data structure that points to its suffixes to make operations on strings a lot faster.

## List of operations
 - checks if a string is a substring of the stored string.
 - checks if a string is a suffix of the stored string.
 - counts the number of occurrences of a string in the stored string.
 - returns the longest repeated substring.
